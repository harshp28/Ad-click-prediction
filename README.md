# Ad-click-prediction
The main motivation behind the project is “Targeted Advertising”. At its most basic, targeted advertising can just mean that ads are chosen for their relevance to site content, in the assumption that they will then be relevant to the site audience as well. Online advertisers can use different methods to target a particular advertisement on the user based on its traits. Most of company do this as part of social media like Facebook, LinkedIn etc. But most of the times the process goes wrong and the advertisement does not reach its target audience because it is sent out without actually understanding the probability of the occurring click.

## Conclusion
Comparing all the above implementation models, we conclude that Naive Bayes Algorithm gives us the maximum accuracy for determining the click probability. We believe in future there will be fewer ads, but they will be more relevant. And also these ads will cost more and will be worth it.
